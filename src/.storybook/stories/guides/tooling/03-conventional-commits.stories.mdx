## Introduction 

Outline uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), A specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages.

Commit messages are in the form: `type(tag): message`.

_Commit messages cannot start with a capital letter or end in punctuation._

Types include:

- `feat`: Feature
- `fix`: Fix
- `fix!` or `feat!`: Breaking change
- `chore` or something else: Ignored

When code is merged, tooling will create a new package version with the `major`.`feature`.`fix` semantic versioning.

For example, if you add a few commit messages:

- `feat: i added a thing`
- `feat: i added a second thing`
- `fix: i fixed the first thing`

If you had a version `1.2.3`, this would create a new version `1.3.0` since there is a new feature. It only increments once even though there are multiple commits.
