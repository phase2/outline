## Commonly Used Commands

Through standard [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scripts), coupled with custom logic in the `./scripts` directory, Outline provides a host of capabilities to provide an incredible developer experience.
- `yarn start` - Runs the local Storybook development server
- `yarn build` - Compiles the system for production to the dist directory
- `yarn test` - Run automated [Web Test Runner](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/) tests 
- `yarn lint` - Runs both [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to evaluate select files for coding standards violations
- `yarn format` - Runs both [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format select files to meet coding standards 
- `yarn build:watch` - Runs `yarn build` in watch mode. Should be ran in conjunction with `yarn wds` described below. 
- `yarn serve` - Runs a basic HTML consumer application with [Web Dev Server](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/) powered by the files in the ./dev directory. Allows for testing components outside of the Storybook interface. Usefully in many testing cases.
  - **Note**: This `yarn serve` can cause issues, and sometimes using `yarn build:watch` and `yarn wds` in separate termininals is recommended.
- `yarn:storybook:axe:dev:chromium` - Runs `axe-core` CLI interface against a local Storybook instance. 
  - **Note**: Storybook, via `yarn start` must be running.
## Resetting local environment

The following commands help clean a local environment.

- `yarn clean` - Cleanup generated assets
- `yarn reset` - Clean all generated assets and re-install dependencies
- `yarn reboot` - Reset the local environment, then restart Storybook

## Coding standards

Code is not automatically formatted upon commit, but automated tests will fail if you don't format code according to the tooling (Prettier).

You can run `yarn fmt` or configure your IDE to run these commands for you.

_Caution: Prettier will sometimes format code in a weird way, so you may want to review its changes._

### Linting

You can run `yarn lint` to view any coding style warnings.
