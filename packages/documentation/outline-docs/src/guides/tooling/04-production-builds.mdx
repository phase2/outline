## Introduction

_This is handled by the GitHub Actions_

Runs both `yarn tsc` and `yarn rollup` to handle the following:

- Packaging individual components to `dist` directory.
- Packaging modern and legacy builds of all components to `dist` directory.

```bash
yarn build
```

> To only run the rollup build, which handles the component bundling into modern and legacy builds:

## One time build

```bash
yarn rollup
```

## Enable in watch mode

```bash
yarn rollup.watch
```
