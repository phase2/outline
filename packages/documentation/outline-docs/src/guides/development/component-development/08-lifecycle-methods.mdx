# Lifecycle Methods
Lit components use the standard custom element [lifecycle](https://lit.dev/docs/components/lifecycle/) methods. 
In addition, Lit introduces a reactive update cycle that renders changes to DOM when reactive properties change.

## List of Lifecycle Methods

```typescript
// Called when an element is created. Also, itâ€™s invoked when an existing
// element is upgraded, which happens when the definition for a custom 
// element is loaded after the element is already in the DOM. 
constructor() {
  super(); 
};

// Invoked when a component is added to the document's DOM.
connectedCallback() { 
  super.connectedCallback() 
};

// Called to determine whether an update cycle is required.
shouldUpdate() {};

// Called before update() to compute values needed during the update.
willUpdate() {};

// Called after the component's DOM has been updated the first time, 
// immediately before updated() is called. 
firstUpdated() {};

// Called to update the component's DOM. 
update(){ 
  super.update(); 
};

// Called to update the component's DOM. 
updated() {};

// Invoked when a component is removed from the document's DOM.
disconnectedCallback() { 
  super.disconnectedCallback() 
}; 

// Called by `update()` and should be implemented to return a renderable result 
// (such as a `TemplateResult`) used to render the component's DOM. 
render() {};
```

[Lifecycle Methods](https://lit.dev/docs/components/lifecycle/) should be placed in approximate chronological order. The render function is placed at the bottom of these. Note that some lifecycle methods require `super` to be called.
