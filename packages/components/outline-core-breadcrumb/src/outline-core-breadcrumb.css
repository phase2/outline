Styles for `outline-core-breadcrumb.css`

=== REMOVE BELOW THIS LINE (AFTER READING) ===
@todo: Extrapolate these comments/documentation to a more official location
Add any component level, structural CSS for the `COMPONENT-NAME` component.
This would be CSS that is targeted to this component only, 
and is dependent on the HTML structure of the component that 
is encapsulated in the component's Shadow DOM.
--- 
Shoud the need arise to style the component based on slotted content 
with an unknown markup structure provided by the consuming application 
in the Light DOM via slots provided by the component, 
consider the following best practices:

The root element of a `slot` should either be 
- Semantically expected tag at the top level 
  - `outline-core-link` for instance requires (if slotted) an `a` tag as the root element of the slot.
  - `outline-core-button` also requires (if slotted) a `button` tag as the root element of the slot.
- A custom element that provides its own styling and encapsulation
  - `outline-core-card` would be a component example that
    - Provides its own styling and encapsulation to handle functionality and responsive behaviors
    - And also either:
      - Instructs the consuming application to provide a custom element as the first level child of a `slot`, thus providing it's own styling. 
      - Allows for slotted content to be styled by the consuming application

Upcoming work will allow for the "styling by the consuming application" option to be more easily 
implemented in a standardized and simplified way.

When updates to build tooling is in place, CSS would be added to an `COMPONENT-NAME.global.css` file, 
and then processed either to be loaded on the fly, or manually via a standard `*.global.css` file.
