# Contributing to Outline

> This document serves to help understand how to setup a local Outline environment, and how to contribute to the open source Outline project For project specific details, please consult the README.md in your project.

## Code of Conduct

We have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/phase2/outline/blob/next/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all interactions with project maintainers and fellow users.

## Setup

Run the following steps to ensure your environment is installed and up to date. This assumes you are using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) locally to manage your NPM version(s).

### Checkout the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:phase2/outline.git && cd outline
```

---

### Ensure you are using the correct version of `npm`

```bash
nvm use
```

If you need to update your node version, see the [usage documentation](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#usage) for nvm.

---

### Install project dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

---

## Storybook Development

Primary component development is done and demonstrated via [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

### Start storybook instance.

```bash
yarn start
```

---

## Testing (pending)

All PRs require passing tests before the PR will be reviewed

Test files should be located in a test folder in your component directory with a .test.ts extension i.e. `src/components/base/outline-element/test/outline-element.test.ts`

Testing is handled by [Web Test Runner](https://modern-web.dev/guides/test-runner/getting-started/) and uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to test modern browsers locally.

Run tests on Chromium, Firefox, and Webkit using
`yarn run test:local`

You can also append one or more browsers to test on specifically i.e.
`BROWSERS=firefox,chromium yarn run test`

Optionally you can run tests using [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) by running
`yarn run test:browserstack`
Note: You must enter your username and access key in the .env file to use BrowserStack testing

More info on writing tests for web components can be found at [Open-WC.org](https://open-wc.org/docs/testing/helpers/)

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are greatly appreciated! To ensure a smooth review process, please follow these steps:

1. Make sure there's an open issue that the PR addresses. Add "Fixes #(issue number)" to the PR description.
2. Please discuss the general shape of the change ahead of time and include screenshots where appropriate. This can save much time for reviewers and submitters alike. Many times there may be existing ideas on how to handle an issue that are not fully written out, and asking about it will bring out more details.
3. All PRs that change behavior or fix bugs should have new or updated tests.
4. Try to create a set of descriptive commits that each do one focused change. Avoid commits like "oops", and prefer commits like "Added method foo to Bar".
5. When addressing review comments, try to add new commits, rather than modifying previous commits. This makes it easier for reviewers to see what changed since the last review.
6. Please run `yarn lint` and `yarn fmt` before submitting PRs. PRs that don't lint and aren't formatted will fail continuous integration tests.

## Commit messages

Outline uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

> The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with [SemVer](https://semver.org/), by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

### Sample commit messages

#### Patch releases

`fix: updated Storybook packages`
This will create a patch release. (1.0.0 --> 1.0.1)

#### Minor releases

`feat: added outline-something component`
This will create a minor release (1.0.0 --> 1.1.0)

`feat(ci): updated CI setup`
This will create a minor release (1.0.0 --> 1.1.0) and uses (ci) to 'tag' this as a feature related to the continuous integration setup.

#### Major releases

```bash
feat: refactoring the something component

BREAKING CHANGE - Requires a rewrite of all your code.
```

This will create a major release. (1.0.0 --> 2.0.0)

---

## Code Cleanup

Code is not automatically formatted upon commit. As a matter of best practices, you should run `yarn fmt` and `yarn lint` prior to committing code in order that pipelines will not fail in the `Test and Build` task.

### Run all Prettier and SVG formatting

```bash
yarn fmt
```

---

### Run Prettier formatting

```bash
yarn fmt.code
```

---

### Run svgo formatting

```bash
yarn fmt.svg
```

---

## Production builds

Runs both `tsc` and `yarn rollup` to handle the following:

- Packaging individual components to `dist` directory.
- Packaging modern and legacy builds of all components to `dist` directory.

```bash
yarn build
```

---

> To only run the rollup build, which handles the component bundling into modern and legacy builds:

### One time build

```bash
yarn rollup
```

---

### Enable in watch mode

```bash
yarn rollup.watch
```

---

## Resetting local environment

The following commands help clean a local environment.

- Cleanup generated assets: `yarn clean`
- Cleanup node packages: `yarn reset`
- Full cleanup & restart: `yarn reboot`
