> This section will provide guidance on the specific usages and patterns for styling a component in Outline.

## Implementation Standards

- `styles` should be defined immediately following the class definition.

## Importing Styles

The styles for Outline components are kept in a typical `.css` file such as `outline-widget.css` that lives parallel to the
component `outline-widget.ts`. These component CSS files utilize [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) processing and a variety of plugins to handle various
features including implementing [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) utility styles to keep the code clean and consistent.

Lit utilizes the static styles to contain any CSS required for a component. The following examples shows us using import to bring in
styles from our `outline-widget.css.lit.ts` file. Any CSS that is included should be wrapped in Litâ€™s `css` template literal.
This is where Outline applies additional logic to handle taking a standard CSS file like `outline-widget.css`,
and converts to `outline-widget.css.lit.ts` which is then imported into the main component file, `outline-widget.ts` as seen in the following code sample.

<Story name="Importing Styles">
  {() => {
    return html`
      <outline-code-block language="typescript" class="mb-6">
        import componentStyles from './outline-widget.css.lit'; ...
        @customElement('outline-widget') export class OutlineWidget extends
        OutlineElement { static styles: CSSResultGroup = [componentStyles]; ...
        }
      </outline-code-block>
    `;
  }}
</Story>

## Inheriting Styles

> Interestingly, the above sample is a component, `OutlineWidget`, that extends `OutlineElement`.
> This component is simply declaring the styles in `OutlineWidget`, and assumes zero style inheritance from the parent component.
> Now, assume that `OutlineElement` provides styles that either should or could be inherited by any component
> that extends it. If we want to include styles from the parent component, we
> need to [inherit styles from the superclass](https://lit.dev/docs/components/styles/#inheriting-styles-from-a-superclass).

<Story name="Inheriting Styles">
  {() => {
    return html`
      <outline-code-block language="typescript" class="mb-6">
        import componentStyles from './outline-widget.css.lit'; ...
        @customElement('outline-widget') export class OutlineWidget extends
        OutlineElement { static styles: CSSResultGroup = [
        OutlineElement.styles, componentStyles ]; ... } ...
      </outline-code-block>
    `;
  }}
</Story>

## Inline Styles

> The following example shows both importing content from the default `outline-widget.css.lit.ts`
> file as well as including inline css wrapped in the `css` string literal provided by the `lit` package.

<Story name="Inline Styles">
  {() => {
    return html`
      <outline-code-block language="typescript" class="mb-6">
        import { css } from 'lit'; import componentStyles from
        './outline-widget.css.lit'; ... @customElement('outline-widget') export
        class OutlineWidget extends OutlineElement { static styles:
        CSSResultGroup = [ componentStyles, css\` :host { display: block; } p {
        margin: 0; } h2 { color: \${this.color} } \` ]; ... } ...
      </outline-code-block>
    `;
  }}
</Story>

Above, we can see above, the `${this.color}` variable is being used to dynamically
set the color of the `h2` element.

> The same effect can be accomplished in the `outline-widgets.css` file by conditionally
> applying custom classes to markup in the `render` method that can be styled with standard CSS.

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

Our components are built with the CSS architecture decoupled from the component functionality.
The component markup never utilizes the Tailwind utility classes that are available,
instead relying on the `.css` file itself to use the Tailwind `@apply` directive to attach
styles to a class or element.
This allows us to use as much (or little) of the Tailwind CSS structure as we want,
and have the ability to transition to other CSS frameworks or methods quickly and easily.

Below is an example of Tailwind classes from our `outline-link.css` file.
Notice how the `@apply` directive precedes a list of shorthand Tailwind classes.
Also note the [`:host`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host) and [`::slotted`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::slotted) selectors. These are very helpful when styling components.

<Story name="Using Tailwind CSS">
  {() => {
    return html`
      <outline-code-block language="css" class="mb-6">
        :host, a, ::slotted(a) { @apply no-underline font-body transition-colors
        duration-300; } :host(:hover), a:hover, ::slotted(a:hover) { @apply
        underline; } :host(:focus), a:focus, ::slotted(a:focus) { @apply
        underline outline-none; }
      </outline-code-block>
    `;
  }}
</Story>

> [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) is some of the best in the industry to find
> particular utility classes you may be looking to utililze in your styles.
> Tailwind documentation should be referenced at every turn in order to understand
> the varying impact each utility class may have, and which ones are available.

## Styling with CSS Variables

Below is an example of CSS Custom Property usage from our `outline-link.css` file.
In this instance, we have utilized 3 custom CSS variables to help us alter the color of a link when using the `outline-link` component.
The next section will discuss how and where those are declared or overwritten.

<Story name="Using CSS Variables">
  {() => {
    return html`
      <outline-code-block language="css" class="mb-6">
        :host, a, ::slotted(a) { color: var(--outline-link-color-default); }
        :host(:hover), a:hover, ::slotted(a:hover) { color:
        var(--outline-link-color-hover) !important; } :host(:focus), a:focus,
        ::slotted(a:focus) { color: var(--outline-link-color-focus) !important;
        }
      </outline-code-block>
    `;
  }}
</Story>

## CSS Variable Declaration

Outline defines all of its CSS Variables in `outline.theme.css`. Many of these CSS variables are utilized by Tailwind CSS as can be seen in the `tailwind.config.js` file.
This means that if you use Tailwind utility classes, they are using the CSS Variables already associated with the design system, and our design tokens.
This ensures that you can adhere to brand guidelines and usage recommendations regardless of how you may choose to architect the CSS or a component or project.

At a project level, each consumer imports this `outline.theme.css` file globally.
This includes Storybook, our simple HTML consumer development environment, as well as Drupal.

Any project should consider adding a project specific CSS Variables file to overwrite only specific properties from Outline, without overriding the variables in `outline.theme.css`.
Again, each consumer would need to include this file, immediately following the inclusion of `outline.theme.css`.
However, this separation is only a suggestion, and in theory the `outline.theme.css` file should be safe to be edited much like the `outline.config.js` system configuration.

<Story name="Defining CSS Variables">
  {() => {
    return html`
      <outline-code-block language="css" class="mb-6">
        :root { ... /* Brand specific primary colors. */
        --blue-responsible-darken-1: #002536; --blue-responsible-darken-2:
        #00374e; --blue-responsible-main: #004e70; --blue-responsible-lighten-1:
        #38758f; --blue-responsible-lighten-2: #9ebcc9;
        --blue-responsible-lighten-3: #ccdce2; --blue-responsible-lighten-4:
        #e0eaee; --blue-responsible-lighten-5: #f0f4f6; ... /* * Configuration
        values for outline-link. */ --outline-link-color-default:
        var(--blue-responsible-darken-1); --outline-link-color-hover:
        var(--blue-responsible-lighten-1); --outline-link-color-focus:
        var(--blue-responsible-lighten-1); ... }
      </outline-code-block>
    `;
  }}
</Story>

Note in the above example, the declaration of the `--blue-responsible` color set,
as well as the configuration for the `outline-link` component.
The first set declares the color values as the hex values,
and the next section associates link colors with a pre-existing CSS variable.

## Component Style Generation

We have talked in previous sections about how the `.css` file will get compiled to a `.css.lit.ts` file.
Let's take a look at a sample of this in action. We will use the `outline-link` component again.

In this example, we see the combination of the samples we used above, including both Tailwind CSS classes and custom CSS Variables for styling.

### `outline-link.css`

<Story name="-- outline-link.css">
  {() => {
    return html`
      <outline-code-block language="css" class="mb-6">
        :host, a, ::slotted(a) { @apply no-underline font-body transition-colors
        duration-300; color: var(--outline-link-color-default); } :host(:hover),
        a:hover, ::slotted(a:hover) { @apply underline; color:
        var(--outline-link-color-hover) !important; } :host(:focus), a:focus,
        ::slotted(a:focus) { @apply underline outline-none; color:
        var(--outline-link-color-focus) !important; }
      </outline-code-block>
    `;
  }}
</Story>

### `outline-link.css.lit.ts`

> The following generated file is ignored by default in `.gitignore`, and is generated during all build procedures.

<Story name="-- outline-link.css.lit.ts">
  {() => {
    return html`
      <outline-code-block language="jsx" class="mb-6">
        import { css } from 'lit'; export default css\` /* Apply standardized
        box sizing to the component. */ :host { box-sizing: border-box; } :host
        *, :host *::before, :host *::after { box-sizing: inherit; } [hidden] {
        display: none !important; } /* Apply component specific CSS */ :host, a,
        ::slotted(a) { font-family: Open Sans, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
        text-decoration: none; transition-property: background-color,
        border-color, color, fill, stroke; transition-timing-function:
        cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1); transition-duration: 300ms;
        color:var(--outline-link-color-default) } :host(:hover), a:hover,
        ::slotted(a:hover) { text-decoration: underline;
        color:var(--outline-link-color-hover) !important } :host(:focus),
        a:focus, ::slotted(a:focus) { text-decoration: underline; outline: 2px
        solid transparent; outline-offset: 2px;
        color:var(--outline-link-color-focus) !important } \`;
      </outline-code-block>
    `;
  }}
</Story>

The above `.ts` file is now what we include directly to our `outline-link.ts` component,
and apply to the `static styles` array. It includes an initial section, applied to all Outline components,
as well as the second sections which are the styles defined by the `.css` file above.
