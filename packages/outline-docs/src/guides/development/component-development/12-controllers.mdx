A reactive controller is an object that can hook into a component's reactive update cycle. Controllers can bundle state and behavior related to a feature, making it reusable across multiple component definitions.

You can use controllers to implement features that require their own state and access to the component's lifecycle, such as:

>- Handling global events like mouse events
>- Managing asynchronous tasks like fetching data over the network
>- Running animations

## Controller Options 
We currently use two main controllers, which are called the lightdom and shadowdom. 

#### Light DOM

#### Shadow DOM (slot manager)

## When do I use what? 
- In general, using the slot manager way makes styling easier, but MAY cause some edge issues that need to be solved. If you use the light DOM controller, you will need to use global styling that follows [BEM](https://getbem.com/).
