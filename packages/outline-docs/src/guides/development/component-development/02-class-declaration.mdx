  ## Description
  Building web components with Outline and Lit2 is a straightforward process thanks to the many tools and extensive documentation we have at the ready. 
  The following section will go over some of the basics as well as reference related resources where appropriate to serve as a basis of how things are, and will be built in your Outline design system.

  ## Documentation Status
  <outline-alert statusType="warning" size="large">
    <span slot="header">Status: Needs Work/In Progress</span>
    <p>
      This documentation is in need of additional work, or is currently in progress.

  </outline-alert>
</outline-container>

## Class and Custom Element Declaration

```typescript
import { customElement } from 'lit/decorators.js';

/** 
 * The Outline Widget component 
 * @element outline-widget 
 */
  
  @customElement('outline-widget') 
  export class OutlineWidget extends OutlineElement { 

  }
```

Here is where we define our component class and the name of the custom element
we are building. Use JSDoc style comments to document the element name, any
slots used, and a brief description of the component and its functionality
