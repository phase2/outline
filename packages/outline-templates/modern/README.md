# Project Title

This project is a modern, efficient, and robust web development environment that leverages several cutting-edge technologies to streamline the development process and enhance the final product's quality.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js and Yarn installed on your local machine. Once you have these prerequisites, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd your-repo-name`
3. Install the dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Build the project: `yarn build`
5. Start the development server: `yarn start`

Now, you should be able to see the project running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Tools Used

* **Turborepo & Yarn Workspaces**: These tools are used for managing packages within the project. Turborepo allows for efficient handling of multi-package repositories, enabling faster build times and improved code sharing across packages. Yarn Workspaces further enhances this by ensuring consistent dependency management, whether the packages are private or public.

* **TypeScript**: This project uses TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, to ensure type safety. This leads to more robust code and allows developers to catch errors early in the development process.

* **Lit2**: Lit2 is used for scaffolding components in this project. It's a simple and powerful library for building fast, lightweight web components. With Lit2, components are easy to create, understand, and test.

* **Astro**: Astro is used for documenting components in this project. It allows developers to write documentation directly alongside their code, making it easier to keep the documentation up-to-date and accurate. Astro's ability to render components in a static HTML format also improves the performance of the documentation site.
