## Outline Basics

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Design Tokens" icon="settings">
    Design tokens are like the building blocks of a design system. Think of them
    as the basic visual elements that form the foundation of the design. They
    include colors, typography, spacing, and more. They help to maintain a
    consistent look and feel across different parts of a project or even across
    different projects.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Typography" icon="add-document">
    Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written
    language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of
    type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing
    (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between
    pairs of letters (kerning).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Iconography" icon="setting">
    Icons are a visual representation of an object, action, or idea. They are
    used to enhance the user experience by helping to communicate functionality
    and provide visual interest.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Spacing, Containers & Grids" icon="open-book">
    Spacing, Containers, and Grids are fundamental aspects of layout design.
    They help to structure and organize the content on a page. Spacing refers to
    the distance or area between, around, above, below, or within elements. It's
    used to give the design a balanced, harmonious look and to provide a clear
    hierarchy. Containers are used to hold and separate different types of
    content. They can be thought of as the 'boxes' that hold your content. Grids
    are a system for creating order among elements in a website. They help to
    align and size objects and can greatly improve the usability and aesthetics
    of a design.
